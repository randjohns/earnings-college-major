visualization of job earnings by college major

This project came from the Dataquest.io course "Exploratory Data Visualization" course. After numerous, enjoyable courses in Python, NumPy, and pandas this course was especially enjoyable as the lists, series, dictionaries, frequency tables, etc. now became fleshed out in graph form. Amazing!

I found the subject matter especially relevant to work at a university too!

Enjoy,
